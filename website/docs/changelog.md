## [Current Version](/clonmapper/pdf/latest/)

In addition to the specific changes listed below this version introduced
an updated website and a reorganization/renaming of some of the sections.
Related to this some of the more generalized procedures were moved to an appendix.

- Switched protocol repo to use public facing [brocklab/clonmapper](https://github.com/brocklab/clonmapper).
- Lentivirus production now uses Lipofectamine 3000 instead of Lipofectamine 2000.
- Targeted barcode amplification changed to a two stage PCR in order to first amplify sequences from genomic DNA,
  then a second reaction to add unique dual indicies for multiplexing/illumina sequencing.
