## AmpureXP Bead PCR Cleanup

<!-- TODO: write info section here
  If there are considerable peaks at 120 bp or less,
  SPRI bead cleanup can be repeated with 1.1X beads to
  further purify PCR sample, but this will greatly reduce yield.
-->

1. Transfer 50 \unit{\uL} PCR amplification product to a
   nuclease-free microcentrifuge tube
1. Allow AmpureXP beads to come to room temperature.
1. Add 35 \unit{\uL} (0.7X) AmpureXP beads and mix
   well with vortexing or pipetting up and down 10 times.
1. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
1. Place the tube on a magnetic rack and allow solution to clear (5-10 minutes).
1. While the tube is on the rack transfer the clear supernatant
   to a new tube without disturbing the bead pellet.
1. Add 45 \unit{\uL} (1.6-0.7x) AmpureXP beads to the supernatant
   from step 10 and mix well with vortexing or pipetting up and down 10 times.
1. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
1. Place the tube on a magnetic rack and allow solution to clear (5-10 minutes).
1. With the tube still in the rack, aspirate the clear supernatant.
1. With the tube still in the rack, add 180 \unit{\uL} of 80% ethanol and
   allow it to sit for 30 seconds.[^cleanup-1]
1. With the tube still in the rack, aspirate the ethanol and repeat step 14.
1. Remove supernatant and allow bead to dry for no **more** than 5 minutes.[^cleanup-2]
1. Remove tube from the magnetic rack and elute DNA
   by adding 42 \unit{\uL} of nuclease-free water.
1. Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
1. Transfer tube to magnetic rack and collect 40 \unit{\uL} of purified
   PCR product after solution has cleared (5-10 minutes).[^cleanup-3]
1. Quantify DNA yield with a high sensitivity fluorometry kit
   ensuring yield between 0.5-10 ng/\unit{\uL}.


[^cleanup-1]: 80% ethanol should be prepared fresh for each PCR cleanup.
[^cleanup-2]: Do not over dry the beads, this can result in a loss of yield and quality.
[^cleanup-3]: Beads may become trapped within the meniscus of the water.
  Pipetting slowly will keep the beads against the wall of the tube
  and leave them in the remaining 2 \unit{\uL} of water.
